# OpenLib - Library Management System using ASP.NET Web Forms üìö

Welcome to OpenLib! I built this application because I was really excited about the idea of building the LMS using the ASP.NET Web-Forms framework, and so I did it!. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this application just as much as I enjoyed building it.
